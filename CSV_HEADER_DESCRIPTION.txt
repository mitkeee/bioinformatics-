NORMALIZED DATA FILES
================================================================================

For machine learning analysis, normalized versions are also generated:

File: results/decision_tree/combined_normalized.csv

Additional columns (z-score normalized per protein):
- stride_asa_norm: Z-score normalized STRIDE ASA
- ncps_sphere_6_norm: Z-score normalized neighbor count (6Å)
- ncps_sphere_10_norm: Z-score normalized neighbor count (10Å)
- ncps_sphere_6_uni_norm: Z-score normalized uniformity (6Å)
- ncps_sphere_10_uni_norm: Z-score normalized uniformity (10Å)
- protein: Protein identifier (3PTE, 4d05, 6wti, 7upo)

Z-score normalization formula: (value - mean) / std
Applied per protein to account for size differences.

NOTES
================================================================================

1. Ground Truth: DSSP and STRIDE are considered ground truth reference methods
   for burial classification and secondary structure.

2. Missing Values: Empty cells indicate data unavailable (e.g., if DSSP/STRIDE
   could not process that residue or calculation failed).

3. Classification Thresholds:
   - Interior (buried): Low ASA, high neighbor count, high uniformity
   - Exterior (exposed): High ASA, low neighbor count, low uniformity

4. Usage: These files are used for:
   - Decision tree classification (decision_tree_zscore_analysis.py)
   - Cross-validation analysis (cross_validation_analysis.py)
   - Performance comparison against reference methods
   - Feature importance analysis

5. File Generation:
   - Run: python protein_burial_analysis.py
   - Or: python extract_ca.py [pdb_file]

EXAMPLE ROW
================================================================================

res_id,res_num,dssp_asa,dssp_class,stride_asa,stride_class,ncps_sphere_6,...
LEU,11,0.0,0,0.0,0,8,0.667,27,0.828,0,H,H

Interpretation:
- Leucine at position 11
- DSSP ASA = 0.0 (completely buried)
- DSSP class = 0 (interior)
- STRIDE ASA = 0.0 (completely buried)
- STRIDE class = 0 (interior)
- 8 neighbors within 6Å (densely packed)
- Uniformity 6Å = 0.667 (uniform distribution)
- 27 neighbors within 10Å (very densely packed)
- Uniformity 10Å = 0.828 (highly uniform)
- Predicted class = 0 (interior) - correct!
- Both DSSP and STRIDE assign alpha helix (H)

This residue is clearly buried in the protein core.
